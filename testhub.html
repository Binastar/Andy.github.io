 <div class="Bina"><p> <h3>CONTRACT REVIEW </h3>

    The Company offers specialist services to meet each customer's needs. Specialist services 
    differ from one customer to another (and from one contract to another), therefore, each 
    tends to be quoted for the specific contract. Once a proposal is accepted by the customer, or 
    an order is placed, it is recorded and reviewed to establish that the requirements of the order 
    are adequately defined and documented, any differences from the proposal are resolved, and 
    the Company is capable of fully satisfying the customer's requirements.
